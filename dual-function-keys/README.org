** Important
   - CAUTION: since we bind LCTRL as HOLD key for space we can't use LCTRL for the LCTRL+SPACE key combination.
     We have to use RCTRL+SPACE.
     see https://gitlab.com/interception/linux/plugins/dual-function-keys/-/issues/15
   - CAUTION2: I'm using my own fork right now as mainline is not really suitable for touch typists with my configuration: https://gitlab.com/fap/dual-function-keys/-/tree/4-hold-delayed
